There is no required textbook for the course, but the following books and lecture notes may be useful:
*	Course materials from [CS 171](https://eecs171.com/) (Undergraduate Cryptography). This is the precursor to our course, and we assume students are familiar with the content.
*   Katz and Lindell's textbook [Introduction to Modern Cryptography](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Cryptography-Chapman-Network-Security/dp/1466570261/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440439512&sr=8-1&keywords=introduction+to+modern+cryptography) is written at an advanced undergraduate level and matches much of the curriculum from CS 171.
*   Boneh and Shoup's upcoming book [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/)
*   Lecture notes by [Pass-Shelat](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4830/2010fa/lecnotes.pdf), [Bellare-Goldwasser](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/gb.pdf) and [Bellare-Rogway](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/cse207/classnotes.html)
*   Goldreich's book: [Foundations of Cryptography Vol. 1](http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Cryptography-1-Basic-Tools/dp/0521035368/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440439391&sr=8-1&keywords=foundations+of+cryptography+basic+tools) and [Vol. 2](http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Cryptography-2-Basic-Applications/dp/052111991X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1440439466&sr=8-2&keywords=foundations+of+cryptography) (some fragments are [freely](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/frag.html) available)
*   Nigel Smart's book: [Cryptography, An Introduction](https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~nigel/Crypto_Book/)
*   Menezes, Oorschot, and Vanstone's book: [Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/)
*   Rosulek's book: [The Joy of Cryptography](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/crypto)
